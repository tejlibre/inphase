                <p>Tropical ecosystems have gone through several extinctions, and drastic reduction in range and abundance of reptile species. The extent of these extincions, range reductions and species loss, and the consequences for several ecosystems are poorly documented compared to other large vertebrate species, especially mammals and birds. Most of the world's developped countries and research institutes are present in the northern hemisphere. This has resulted in a disproportionately high level of research in countries with temperate climates and low levels of biodiversity. There is a historical bias concerning the importance of reptiles as players in ecological processes. In some ecological hotspots like mauritius, there were no mammals before the arrival of humans 400 years ago, and the reptiles occupied the major ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>I live in mauritius, an ecological hotspot with many rare endemic species that are threatened of extinction. NGO's actively working in conservation need help with survey and monitoring. Computer vision can help in these surveys by automating and making tedious tasks more efficient.

<p>Computer vision is a branch of artificial intelligence, where images are analyzed by computers to draw some conclusion, for example whether an object was detected, what kind of object it was, what is the texture. It has applications ranging from medical images to detect anomalies indicating disease, self driving cars detecting obstacles or signage, to face detection and remote sensing.</p>
<p>A typical computer vision pipeline for ecological monitoring of reptiles looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Image aquisition: obtaining images using camera traps in the field (or online datasets)</li>
<li>Preprocessing: Cropping to rectangular Region of Interest, resizing, aspect ratio</li>
<li>Segmentation: Separate individual animal from background, habitat, and other individual parts</li>
<li>Feature extraction and selection: For reptiles, the features we are interested in are marks and spot patterns. There are also CNN methods, more on this later</li>
<li>High level processing: one vs one matching (finding similarity score) or One vs Many  Matching (class identification)</li>
</ul>
<p>The final step is related to the objective of the ecologist.</p>
<p><em>Instance recognition</em> is the problem of finding images in a database that match a query image. Perhaps we want to identify the label of the individual, rather than returning all matching images.</p>
<p><em>Category recognition</em> is the problem of identifying the class an image belongs to, example car, person, or the species to which the animal belongs</p>
<p>Machine learning techniques to implement the feature extraction and high level processing parts fall into either classical machine learning or deep learning techniques categories. Machine learning itself is a process where computers perform a certain task using an algorithm over and over and a value is optimized for, in a way that we say the the computer is learning when that value reaches a minimum.</p>
<p>Classical machine learning techniques used traditionally been quite effective, and are still used in many cases. They are rule based approaches and computer scientists understand their inner workings very well. They are particularly effective at detecting presence absence, measurements, averaging numerical values.</p>
<p>Deep learning techniques have surpassed machine learning techniques in many respects, especially for more complex problems such as detecting texture, nuances and complex anomalies. Deep learning is a class of techniques that make use of <em>Artificial Neural Networks</em> which simulates the way the human brain works to make decisions. A deep neural network is when there is more than one hidden layer between the input and output layer</p>
<p>Deep learning is therefore quite powerful at detecting subtle patterns that can be used as a species or individual classification tool.</p>
