                <p>Tropical ecosysteems have gone through several extinctions and drastic reduction in range and abundance of reptile species. The extent of these extincions, range reductions and species loss, and the consequences for several ecosystems are poorly documented compared to other large vertebrate species, especially mammals and birds. Most of the world's developped countries and research institutes are present in the northern hemisphere. This has resulted in a disproportionately high level of research in countries with temperate climates and low levels of biodiversity. There is a historical bias concerning the importance of reptiles as players in ecological processes. In some ecological hotspots like mauritius, there were no mammals before the arrival of humans 400 years ago, and the reptiles occupied the major ecological roles such as pollination and seed dispersal.</p>
<p>I live in mauritius, an ecological hotspot with many rare endemic species that are threatened of extinction. NGO's actively working in conservation need help with survey and monitoring. Computer vision can help in these surveys by automating and making tedious tasks more efficient. A typical computer vision pipeline consists of </p>
<ul>
<li>Image aquisition: obtaining images using camera traps in the field (or online datasets)</li>
<li>Preprocessing: Cropping to rectangular Region of Interest, resizing, aspect ratio</li>
<li>Segmentation: Separate individual animal from background, habitat, and other individual parts</li>
<li>Feature extraction and selection: For reptiles, the features we are interested in are marks and spot patterns. There are also CNN methods, more on this later</li>
<li>High level processing: one vs one matching (finding similarity score) or One vs Many  Matching (class identification)</li>
</ul>
<p>The final step is related to the objective of the ecologist.</p>
<p><em>Instance recognition</em> is the problem of finding images in a database that match a query image. In our case we want to identify the label of the individual, rather than returning all matching images.</p>
<p><em>Category recognition</em> is the problem of identifying the class an image belongs to, example car, person, or in our case the species</p>
